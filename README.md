## This is my repository for data science related notebooks

In this repository I'm solving data-related problems using statistical and machine learning methods. In some cases I'm using my own framework basing on sklearn and statsmodels - for convinience. These files are not uploaded in my github because I keep adding new features to boost productivity and reduce the time needed for pure coding. If you are interested in seeing it anyways, please send me a message.


#### Available now:

1. Linear regression - solving the diamonds dataset (with nonlinear variables) using solely linear estimates. The testing set $R^2 = 0.98$ was reached.
